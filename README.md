 ## CSS Media Queries
 
 Media query is a CSS technique introduced in CSS3.

 It uses the @media rule to include a block of CSS properties only if a certain condition is true.
 
 With Media Queries, we can tell the navigator : if the size of the screen is X, use these css properties, otherwise those. 
 
 ### The Challenge
 
 In this repo ,with a *HTML* and *CSS* files:
 
 * the body background color changes with the responsive property,
 * *DIVs*  are displayed, according to the width of the current viewport.
 * Adapt the size of the text according to the device
 * Re-Arrange *DIVs*
